  The aim of the Polymer Module is to give an overview of different Polymer
  Materials and their typical production technologies for the development of a
  light- and cost effective product. You will get a detailed overview of the
  basic Polymer properties and how to transfer theses, into industrial
  applications.


  After successful completing of the »POLYMER« advance level of the lightweight professional training course, the participants will be able to:


  * Differentiate various Polymer types according their properties

  * Evaluate the best Polymer material for right application

  * Distinguish between different manufacturing processes concerning the Material and functionality of the Lightweight part

  * Planning and transfer of laboratorial knowledge to industrial scale
contents: |-
  * Fundamentals of Polymers and Polymer technology
  * Polymer design
  * Material characterization
  * Manufacturing methods/technology in theory and practice
  * Testing methods for the mechanical characterization
  * Case studies
