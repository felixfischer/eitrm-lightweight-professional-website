  The objective of the FRP Module is to give an overview of all key aspects of
  fiber reinforced plastics, which must be taken into account when lightweight
  design strategies are applied. This then allows the participants to select the
  most suitable Advanced Modules to take.


  On completion of this module the course participants will be able to understand which factors are not only important for the manufacture and use of fiber reinforced plastics but also crucial for the application of lightweight design in the development of fiber reinforced plastic products.
