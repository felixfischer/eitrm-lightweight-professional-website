title: Powder Metallurgy and Additive Manufacturing
level: Advanced
summary: This module describes, among others, additive manufacturing...
desc: >-
  This module aims to give you an overview of metal powders and how they can be
  used to produce components that have a lower mass than conventional production
  routes.  One application for metal powders that is subject to much attention
  is additive manufacturing, also known with the name of metal 3D printing. 
  This module will describe additive manufacturing techniques and how they may
  be deployed to reduce mass in service.


  By the end of this module, you should be able to:


  * Explain how components made from metal powders and/or by additive manufacturing can be used to reduce mass, compared to cast and machined components.

  * Describe the main routes by which metal powders can be converted in to solid, dense components.

  * Describe the main additive manufacturing production routes.

  * Relate manufacturing techniques to the types of powder that are optimal for each process.

  * Describe how powders may be characterised, what properties are relevant for different manufacturing techniques and the techniques that can be used to measure such characteristics.

  * Critically assess the suitability of a powder for a process or vice-versa.

  * Explain how a general component could be redesigned to take advantage of additive manufacturing and how this could lead to lightweighting.
