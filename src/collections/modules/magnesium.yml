  The aim of the MAGNESIUM Module is to give an overview of potential for the
  application magnesium alloys and applicable production technologies, depending
  on objectives for the development of a lightweight product. You will also
  learn what you need and how to transfer the laboratorial knowledge to
  industrial scale.


  After successful completing of the »MAGNESIUM« advance level of the lightweight professional training course, the participants will be able to:


  * differentiate various magnesium alloys according to their functionality

  * understand which factors are important from the development of a lightweight product from the view of material and technology

  * planning and transfer of laboratorial knowledge to industrial scale

  * distinguish between different manufacturing methods and requirements for their implementation
contents: |-
  * Fundamentals of magnesium and magnesium technology
  * Alloying design
  * Material characterization
  * Manufacturing methods/technology in theory and practice
  * Case studies
recommendedKnowledge: No prior knowledge is required to take this module.
