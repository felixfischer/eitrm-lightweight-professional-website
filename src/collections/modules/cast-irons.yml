title: Cast Irons
fullTitle: Advanced Cast Irons
level: Advanced
summary: In this module, you will learn how a »conventional« material, such as
  Cast Iron, can become strategic for lightweight applications, thanks to
  innovative processes and treatments.
desc: The mission of cast iron Module is to offer a complete overview of
  different cast iron materials (according to international standards), from
  grey iron to austempered ductile iron, to the point of comparing cast irons
  with steels. This module is structured for analyzing different foundry
  production processes and also to examine in depth all properties and technical
  advantages of cast irons materials, which are everyday more relevant in
  (lightweight) design components, maintaining always a focus on low
  environmental impact. All participants will have the chance to study other
  important topic as quality requirement and casting defects, fatigue design and
  surface heat treatment up to a special welding and joining topic about cast
  irons. At the end of the course, this module will show some real successful
  examples of lightweight designed components.
