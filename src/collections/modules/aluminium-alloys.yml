title: Aluminium Alloys
fullTitle: Aluminium Light Alloys
level: Advanced
summary: In this module, you will learn the excellent lightweight potential of
  Aluminium and its alloys, which can be exploited into industrial
  components  thanks to a wide variety of processing solutions.
desc: After an introductory review of key-properties of Aluminium and its
  alloys, and a summary of relevant application fields, this Module will address
  the main processing routes (primary production, recycling, rolling, extrusion,
  casting) and the guidelines for alloys and processes selection. Welding and
  joining processes, which are fundamental in several industrial application
  fields will be presented, as well as the challenging solutions offered by
  conventional and innovative surface finishing techniques. Basic concepts to be
  adopted in quality control and evaluation will be described. The main
  techniques for process and properties modelling will be reviewed, to properly
  approach design methods and solutions suitable for Aluminium alloys. The
  Module will finally include some case studies of development of Aluminium
  alloys components for lightweight, taking into account both rolled and/or
  extruded and cast components. All case studies will present, taking advantage
  from LCA and other software tools, the eco-sustainability potential associated
  to Aluminium alloys.
