  The aim of the STEEL Module is to give an overview of steel grades and the
  applicable production technologies, depending on the objectives for the
  development of a lightweight product. You will also learn what you need and
  how to transfer the laboratorial knowledge to industrial scale.


  After successful completing of the »STEEL« advance level of the lightweight professional training course, the participants will be able to:


  * differentiate various steel grades according to their functionality

  * understand which factors are important from the development of a lightweight product from the view of material and technology

  * planning and transfer of laboratorial knowledge to industrial scale

  * distinguish between different manufacturing methods and requirements for their implementation
contents: |-
  * Fundamentals of steel and steel technology
  * Alloying design
  * Material characterization
  * Manufacturing methods/technology in theory and practice
  * Case studies
recommendedKnowledge: No prior knowledge is required to take this module.
