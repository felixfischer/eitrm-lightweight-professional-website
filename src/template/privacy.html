<h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Data protection</h3>
<p>
  The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your

  confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection
  regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e.,
  through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not

</p>
<h3>
  Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in
  the GDPR)
</h3>
<p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
<p>
  EIT RawMaterials GmbH<br />
  Tauentzienstr. 11<br />
  Europa Center<br />
  10789 Berlin
</p>

<p>
  Phone: +49 30 263 66 46 60<br />
  E-mail: info@eitrawmaterials.eu
</p>
<p>
  The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or
  jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for
  the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
</p>

<h3>Storage duration</h3>
<p>
  Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy
  policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it
  was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for
  deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted,
  unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal
  data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the
  deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

</p>
<h3>Information on data transfer to the USA</h3>
<p>
  Our website uses, in particular, tools from companies based in the USA. When
  these tools are active, your personal information may be transferred to the US
  servers of these companies. We must point out that the USA is not a safe third
  country within the meaning of EU data protection law. US companies are
  required to release personal data to security authorities without you as the
  data subject being able to take legal action against this. The possibility
  cannot therefore be excluded that US authorities (e.g. secret services) may
  process, evaluate, and permanently store your data on US servers for
  monitoring purposes.  We have no influence over these processing activities.
</p>
<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
<p>
  A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your
  express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already
  given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data
  collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
</p>
<h3>
  Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to
  direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
</h3>
<p>
  IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E OR
  F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
  PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO
  APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL
  BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA
  PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS
  YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING
  PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
  INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE
  CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO
  ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR).
</p>
<p>
  IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
  ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF
  YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING. THIS ALSO
  APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT
  ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE
  USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 2
  GDPR).
</p>
<h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
<p>
  In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a
  complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where
  they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the
  alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect
  regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal
  recourses.
</p>
<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
<p>
  You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically
  process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be
  handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
  format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
  controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
</p>
<h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
<p>
  For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content,
  such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator,
  this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize
  an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
  switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock
  icon in the browser line.
</p>
<p>
  If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be
  read by third parties.
</p>
<h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
<p>
  Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to
  at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source
  and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data. You may
  also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have
  questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal
  data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
</p>
<h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
<p>
  You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the
  processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at
  any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
  following cases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived
    by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time
    that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we
    restrict the processing of your personal data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful
    manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of
    your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise,
    defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the
    restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its
    eradication.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your
    rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as
    it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
    demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with
  the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your
  consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the
  rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public
  interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.
</p>
<h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
<h3>Server log files</h3>
<p>
  The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores
  information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates to
  us automatically. The information comprises:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
  <li>The used operating system</li>
  <li>Referrer URL</li>
  <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
  <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
  <li>The IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
<p>
  This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator
  of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free
  depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve
  this, server log files must be recorded.
</p>
<h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
<p>
  If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all
  resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for
  the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without
  your consent.
</p>
<p>
  These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR if your
  inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the
  performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
  processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of
  inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on the basis of your
  consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR) if it has been obtained.
</p>
<p>
  The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you
  request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for
  the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory
  statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain
  unaffected.
</p>
<h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
<h3>Newsletter data</h3>
<p>
  If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we
  will need from you an e-mail address as well as information that allow us to
  verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided, and consent to
  the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall be
  collected only on a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the
  sending of the requested information and shall not share such data with any
  third parties.
</p>
<p>
  The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription
  form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit.
  a GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data,
  the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the
  newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in
  the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data
  processing transactions that have taken place to date.
</p>
<p>
  The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter
  will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the
  newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list
  after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to
  apply. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our
  newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our
  legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>
  After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail
  address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist
  to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this
  purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our
  interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters
  (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The
  storage in the blacklist is indefinite.
  <strong
    >You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate
    interest.</strong

</p>
<h3>MailChimp</h3>
<p>
  This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The
  provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite
  5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.
</p>
<p>
  Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organize
  and analyze the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the
  purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail address), the
  information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.
</p>
<p>
  With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyze the performance of
  our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that has been sent through the
  MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail (a so-called
  web-beacon) connects to MailChimp’s servers in the United States. As a result,
  it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which
  links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical information is also
  recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type of
  browser and operating system). This information cannot be allocated to the
  respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the performance of
  statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of such analyses can
  be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more
  effectively.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe
  from the newsletter. We provide a link for you to do this in every newsletter
  message.
</p>
<p>
  The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR).  You
  may revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the
  newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data
  processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.
</p>
<p>
  The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter
  will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the
  newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list
  after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with
  us remain unaffected.
</p>
<p>
  Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)
  of the European Commission. Details can be found here:

  >.
</p>
<p>
  After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail
  address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist
  to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this
  purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our
  interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters
  (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The
  storage in the blacklist is indefinite.

</p>
<h4>Execution of a contract data processing agreement</h4>
<p>
  We have executed a so-called “Data Processing Agreement” with MailChimp, in
  which we mandate that MailChimp undertakes to protect the data of our
  customers and to refrain from sharing it with third parties.
</p>
