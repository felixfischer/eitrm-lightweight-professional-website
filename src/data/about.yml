title: About the Lightweighting Professional Course
intro: Reducing the weight of structures has become a critical point of focus
  for many different sectors, such as machine building, transportation and civil
  construction.
body: The appropriate handling of raw materials in lightweight design structures
  is the key success factor for preserving resources and reducing costs.
  Unfortunately, practical experience often shows that designing and handling
  rules for new materials are not being respected. The professional training
  concept underlying in the Lightweight Professional courses addresses this
  issues.
questions:
  - q: What will you learn in this programme?
    a: Participants will be able to identify and differentiate the steps involved in
      developing lightweight products. They will learn how to use, design,
      construct and set up processes with specific lightweight materials in the
      correct way to fully utilise the potential of lightweight strategies.
