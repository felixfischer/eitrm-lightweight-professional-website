# Fiber Reinforced Plastics

## Fiber Reinforced Plastics (Advanced Level)

The objective of the FRP Module is to give an overview of
all key aspects of fiber reinforced plastics, which must be
taken into account when lightweight design strategies are
applied. This then allows the participants to select the
most suitable Advanced Modules to take.

On completion of this module the course participants will be
able to understand which factors are not only important for
the manufacture and use of fiber reinforced plastics but
also crucial for the application of lightweight design in
the development of fiber reinforced plastic products.

## Course content

* Fiber and matrix systems
* Component design
* Material characterization
* Manufacturing methods in theory and practice
* Important parameters for the machining, coating, joining,
  and repair of fiber reinforced plastics
* Ageing and recycling
* Health and safety at work and environmental protection
