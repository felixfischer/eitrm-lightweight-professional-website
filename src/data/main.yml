  title: About the Lightweighting Professional Course
  intro: >-
    Reducing the weight of structures has become a critical
    point of focus for many different sectors, such as
    machine building, transportation and civil construction.
  body: >-
    The appropriate handling of raw materials in lightweight
    design structures is the key success factor for
    preserving resources and reducing costs. Unfortunately,
    practical experience often shows that designing and
    handling rules for new materials are not being
    respected. The professional training concept underlying
    in the Lightweight Professional courses addresses this
    issues.

questions:
  - q: What will you learn in this programme?
    a: >-
      Participants will be able to identify and
      differentiate the steps involved in developing
      lightweight products. They will learn how to use,
      design, construct and set up processes with specific
      lightweight materials in the correct way to fully
      utilise the potential of lightweight strategies.

  - q: Is this course for you?
    a: >-
      The courses are aimed at employees in industry whose
      work involves planning the manufacture of
      lightweight products, and at employers who want to
      start manufacturing products based on lightweight
      concepts. The basic level is designed for
      managers, engineers and technical staff. The
      advanced and expert levels are for technical
      experts.
