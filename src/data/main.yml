  title: About Lightweight Professional Course
  subtitle: >-
    Reducing the weight of structures has become a critical
    point of focus for many different sectors, such as
    machine building, transportation and civil construction.
  body: >-
    The appropriate handling of raw materials in lightweight
    design structures is the key success factor for
    preserving resources and reducing costs. Unfortunately,
    parctical experience often shows that designing and
    handling rules for new materials are not being
    respected. The professional training concept underlying
    in the Lightweight Professional courses addresses this
    issues.
  subsections:
    - title: What will you learn in this programme?
      body: >-
        Participants will be able to identify and
        differentiate the steps involved in developing
        lightweight products. They will learn how to use,
        design, construct and set up processes with specific
        lightweight materials in the correct way to fully
        utilise the potential of lightweight strategies.
